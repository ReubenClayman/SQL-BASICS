-- This part calculates the average salary of all employees in the 'Sales' department. The result of this subquery is a single value (the average salary).

SELECT AVG(salary) 
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

-- This subquery stores the average salary of 'Sales' employees in a variable.

-- This effectively adds a new column to the result set containing the average salary of 'Sales' employees for each employee.

SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    salary, 
    department,
    (SELECT AVG(salary) 
     FROM employees
     WHERE department = 'Sales') AS avg_sales_salary
FROM employees;

-- This query finds employees who earn more than the average salary of 'Sales' employees.
-- This subquery is used within the WHERE clause of the main query. It calculates the average salary of 'Sales' employees.
-- The main query then selects only those employees whose salary is greater than the calculated average salary of 'Sales' employees.

SELECT 
    employee_id, 
    salary, 
    department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
                FROM employees
                WHERE department = 'Sales');
